Most studies have quantified the global land reserve from a top-down perspective relying on global models and statistics that neglect spatial information and local realities such as use by local communities, degraded soils, land zoning, land tenure, conservation concerns and transportation infrastructure.  We will explore these issues using peer-reviewed manuscripts, grey literature, newspaper articles, maps, and census data, and attempt to navigate the constraints and opportunities to utilize the land reserve over the next 5-10 years.  The land reserve is concentrated in Latin America’s cerrados and grasslands, Indonesia grasslands, African savannas and abandoned / idle farmland in the US, Europe and following the collapse of the Soviet Union.'+
